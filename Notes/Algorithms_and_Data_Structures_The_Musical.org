#+TITLE: Algorithms & Data Structures: From Physics to Society

* Heuristic
- do something quantative where possible (learn data scraping, statistics)


* Topic Ideas

** On Keyboards
- the left today are gleeful to exclaim that just about everything from common sense to men is the product of wetern imperialism, one thing that actually is, is keyboards.
  + had the chinese invented keyboards....

** Timeline Exploerers
Natural way of exploring data, why aren't they more common
- Example: developmental psychology timeline of children learing abilities

** On Scientific Papers (and technical writing)
- every paper should come with a github repository. The frontier of science is computations
- interactivity (bret victor)
- citations should be sortable by most recommended to least, by tag (auto generated), by citations etc,  
- all of this would probably require a journal to inforce these new standards on the writer
- commenty should be part of the package 
- ideas are the first class citizens (ideas = datastructure+algorithm (macro))
- Problem: semantic overloading, clear definitions are not always stated
  + NOT an easy problem to solve in english, you 
- incentive to over publish. Wouldnt it be nice if people only published when they actually discovered somthing, rather than paying people to make something up x times a year every year

** On Democracy
- P1. we dont live in very democratic democracies
- Options:
  a) democracy is good -> democracy++
  b) democracy is bad -> democracy--
  c) the illusion of democracy is good but democracy is bad -> democracy--
  d) is complicated -> we have a serious conversation about the nature of democracy

** On universities
- we need to conceptually split 1) education & 2) research

*** Education

*** Research
**** Research vs Industry

** On Cognitive Science
- what is its place? [citeeeeeeeee decline of cogsci!!]
- define the goals
- the definition is not to broard, but not broard enough
  + we need to resurect some more ancient ideas of knowledge
  + we can fold everything! into the definiton of congnitive science
- *Meta-progress* indirect  :concept:
  + e.g. doing things that allow cognitive science to improve- personal productivity, the stucture of academia, lifespan etc.

*** Meta-Cogntive Science
- a new branch of cognitive science based on derivatives.
- indirectly attacking the engineering problem of ai and cognition
- we need to build models of the models

** On Tech, Silicon Vally and Startup Culture
- Assumption: great stagnation, tyler cowan, peter tiel 
- the one area of society there has been progress in in tech
- where did this progress come from?
  + technological improvements: mores law etc.. 
  + 2nd order tools, vc funding, mindset, github, culture
- if the second then this is exportable to the rest of culture society and industry


** Wolfram Physics Project for the Mind?

* The Structure of Documents

** Literate Programming

** Inspectable Elements (game design)

** Metadata



* Data Structures vs Data and Structures
- which should be in the title?

* Quotes

** Wittgenstein

** All Other
"Before there were computers, there were algorithms, but now there are computers there are even more algorithms" - CLRS chap 0


* Reading List
- Joshua Bach
- Wittgenstein
- Karl Frixton
