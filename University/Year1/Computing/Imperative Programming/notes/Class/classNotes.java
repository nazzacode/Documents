/*
Summary We looked at:
- using client programs to motivate our classes, and to test them
    instance variables:
- represent data that is particular to an object (i.e., an instance!); I have scope over the whole class;
- can hold mutable state;
- can be manipulated by any instance method in the class.
    instance methods:
- like static methods, but can only be called on some object o;
- have access to the data that is speciÔ¨Åc to o. I constructors:
- we create a new object of class Foo with the keyword new;
- we initialise an object of type Foo by calling the constructor for that type; - the constructor is used to store data values
