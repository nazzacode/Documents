#+TITLE: Nativism & Empiricicm

* Introduction
Nativism and empiricism are polar explainations of how knowledge and personality develop
*Nativism* essential elements in our /understanding/
*Empiricism* knowledge is obtained through /experience/

* History & Behaviorism
- the debate emerged from 17th century
- there was a general pro Empiricist consensus disregarding Nativism as unscientific
- Empiricism was closely tied to /Behaviorism/
*Behaviorism* belief that behaviour can be fully explained without (i.e. stupid)
     - /Skinner/ argued behaviour is acquired through the principle of /stimuli -> reinforcement conditioning/

* Chomsky
Chomsky revived nativism with his work on language acquisition
 - He noted (1) Language is extremly complex, and (2) children pick it up quickly with very little training
 - (1) is not obvious, he showed grammatical structure is sufficiently complex to imply that a child's mastery of entails an ability to systemise beyond experience and the limit of generalisation (poverty of stimulus argument)

* Evolution
- its not sensible to talk about experiencing reality directly
- our perceptual system reconstructs reality in a way that has benifits our system
- /Example/ Sugar is not inately sweet and visual stimuli contain such a vast set of input data for us to interpret that we use powerful innate heuristics to distinguish from the infinity of interpretations
