# Causal Cognition Week 2 Notes 

## Part 1 - Behaviorism and associative learning

## Part 2 - Delta-P and causal Power

## Part 3 - How to represent Structure
- directed acyclic graphs (DAG)
- chain structure vs common cause structure in a 3 node 2 edge DAG are Markov indistinguishable as causality is not part of the model.
Markov Equivalence Classes
  : it doesnt matter which way the lines are drawn

## Part 4 - Causal Model Theory
Pearl's 'do' calculus
  : captures how markov equivalent models differ in terms of their causal implications and predictions

### causal blocking studies
"Causal model theory does not predict competition among cues, it predicts potential competition among causes in common-effect structures" - (Waldmann, 2000)


## Part 5 - Early Experimental Evidence supporting Causal Model Theory (CMT)
