# Causal Cognition Week 3: The Ladder of Causation

## Part 1 - From seeing to doing
- Ceterius paribus (all other things equal), the more variables in a CBN, the greater the chance that an observed (unconditional) association is due to shared ancestor rather than a direct connection
- the vast majority of associations are spurious. For example, divorce rates in Maine and per capita consumption of margarine (r=0.993**)

## Part 2 - Interventions

## Part 3 - Interventions in Individual Cognition

## Part 4 - Counterfactuals
Hypotheticals vs. Counterfactuals 
  : Hypotheticals do not contradict what we know to be true of the present and past

Shallow vs. Deep Counterfactuals
  : if the world had no gravity from now onwards vs. never evolving with gravity.
