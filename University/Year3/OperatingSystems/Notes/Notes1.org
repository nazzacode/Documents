#+TITLE: Operating Systems (OS): Notes 1

* Aliases
| Alias | Full           |   |
|-------+----------------+---|
| spec  | specification  |   |
| UI    | user interface |   |
| mshn  | machine        |   |
| virt  | virtual        |   |

* TODO Reasearch
- [ ] try all the tiling window managers in virt mshn
- [ ] try all the desktop environments
- [ ] try redox (rust os)
- [ ]

* What is a Kernel?
** <<<Kernel>>> : it handles events generated by hardware (interrupt) and software (system call) and manages access to resources.
*** <<<Interrupt>>> : Event generated by hardware :def:
*** <<<System Call>>> : Events generated by software :def:
* Major OS Services (L2b)
** processes
** memory
** I/O
** Secondary Storage
** File Systems
** Protection
** Networking
** Shell (Higher Abstraction)
** GUI (Higher Abstraction)

* Processes (L3.1)
* Threads (L3.2)
- Concurrent execution :: multiple tasks time sharing on a single core
- Parallel execution :: multiple CPU cores
- Threads :: share memory between two processes naturally by combining two multiple processes into a single process with multiple threads
  + Thread :: defines a sequential execution flow within a process
    - a thread is bound to a single process
- *Threads become the unit of scheduling*
  + processes are just /containers/ in which threads execute
- kernel level threading vs user level threading
* Scheduling (L4.1)
- CPU schedules :: CPU bound vs IO bound
** Performace Goals
- Max CPU utilisation
- Max throughput (processes completed per time unit)
- Min turnaround time (time from submission of task to completion)
- Min waiting time (all time spent waiting the ready queue from submission)
- Min response time (from submission of request to response produced)
- Min energy (joules per instruction) (recent: e.g mobile)


* Comparison of Command Shells
| Name       | Overview                 |
|------------+--------------------------|
| bash       | Unix Standard            |
| zsh        | bash++ macOS standard    |
| fish       | TODO                     |
| starship   | experimnetal table views |
| ion        | redox os                 |
| Powershell | windows pish             |

* Graphic User Interfaces
* User Interface
** PROJ I wish to desgin a user interface (UI) for VR
*** Use Spec (Specification)
- view see multiple desktops
*** Window Manager Spec
- [ ] ability to maximise windows in their frame ( TODO definition?)
- [ ] circular arrays (Xmonad?)
*** Window Spec
** Windactic Sugar to Have
- Ability to name every tab
- recursive. easy to display

* References
** DONE work this shit out
