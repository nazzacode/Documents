## Company Notes

**GIS - Geographic Information System:** way to visualise and process data as maps
- ? seems large product; how exactly do you use it?, why competitive advangate?

Graph Theory & Topology


**MySQL:**
- SQL commands cheatsheet 

**Docker:**
- packs software into standardised units (containers)
- like a virtual machine for the os rather than handware
- focus on developing rather than setting up dev environmens
- 
**Docker swarm:**
- group of vms that have been joined together in a cluster 
- like kubernetes

**Apache Spark/Hadoop:** 
- parallelises data operations
-
-

## Talking Points
- I really like your website
- Covid-19 as Datascience
    - are governments implementing data driven solutions


## Questions
- what would you have me work on?

- opportunity for tech literate companies to become powerful adopters and explorers in the landscape of remote work.
    - how have/are you as a company adapting?
    - are there any tools, structures best practices from the world remote work you would like to keep and futher integrate after lockdown ends?
