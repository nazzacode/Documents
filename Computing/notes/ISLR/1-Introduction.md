# An Introduction to Stastistical Learning With Applications in R

# Chapter 1: Introduction

- first thing you do -> look at the data, make some graphs

## Supervised Learning
Starting point
    - Outcome Y (dependant variable, respone, target)
    - Vector of predictor measurements X: (inputs, regressors, covariates, features, independent variables)
    - *regression* -> Y is quantitive (e.g price, blood pressure)
    - *classification* -> Y is finite (e.g survided/died, diget, cancer class)
    - Training data (x1, y1),...,(xn, yn).

On the basis of the training data we would like to:
    - accuratly predict unseen cases
    - understand which inputs affect outcome and how
    - assess the quality of our predictins and inferences

## Statistical Learning vs Machine Learning
Statistical Learning has greater emphasis on models and *interpretability*, *precision* and *uncertainty*.
