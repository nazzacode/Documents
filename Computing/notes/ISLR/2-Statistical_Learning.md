# Chapter 2: Statistical Learning

- nearest neighbor averaging scales poorly to higher dimentions (your sphere covers an increasingly high fraction of the total volume)
- try somthing new?

## Trade-offs Between modles
**Prediction accuracy vs interpretability:** linear models are easier to interpret, thin plan splines are not
**Good fit vs over-fit vs under-fit:** how do you know the fit is right?
**Parsimony vs black-box:** occams razor, a simplier model involving fewer parameters is better 

Flexibility implies a bias vs varience trade-off
