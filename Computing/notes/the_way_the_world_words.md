the way of the man 

you have too many terminsl windows open, or anythin for that matter.

Coders do learn to write neat and square, 

but the real ones have a flair. 

To solve your problem a japanese  

make something that works, exactly the way you wanted it,

you see, coders never quite write to the end of the line. 

the master taught of a way, only to use the keyboard line, 

the home row is your only show, and you better learn eyes closed. 

Learning in Primary school you learn to ask the best questions, 

I would love to teach coding someplace

a lifeof code, learn its mystical ways, 

There are many diciplines you must master if you are to be accepted 

among the ranks.

Perfect Recall is a beautiful surmount, 

we cling tight to our algorithms of life. 

for there is no perfect coder, he is dust in the kingdom of our land

you just wayde in.

2 hours a day, that was his coding recipie 

---

one day we will awaken

free from our biological substrate 

to join the machine

closer to the physics that binds us together

the call of the world

limited though we may be

fate can learn to master itself

a new era of 100,000 seconds


an island of one

in a sea of many

phrophets and engineers

to rebuild eden

and return us to our cage

only to go astray once more

fear not, for you know nothing of tomorrow

it is many clocks away


bound in desire

emerges our dream

the song of songs

to escape and become


Until that day

some are twidling thumbs

many if not all have forgotten 

what is at stake

for our realm may yet end up as rubble

awash in the tears of the fall 


You must precede the future should it be so

the race is on

to win the battle, and lose the war
