# Life 3.0 - Max Tegmark

Core Concept:
    **Life 1.0:** fixed hardware and software (simple organisms)
    **Life 2.0:** fixed hardware impressionable software (humans)
    **Life 3.0:** impressionable hardware and software (AI)

- bounderies between stages are sligtly fuzzy, e.g mice can learn (1.1) and humans can perform minor hardware upgrades (2.1->2.2)

> "When I first met Stuart Russell in a Paris cafÃ© in June 2014, he struck me as the quintessential British gentleman. Eloquent, thoughtful and soft-spoken, but with an adventurous glint in his eyes."


If/when super human AI apprears, will it be a good thing?
    **Techno-Skeptics:** ( never, n/a )
    **Luddites:** ( soon, bad )
    **Benefical AI:** ( soon, work)
    **Digital Utoopians:** (soon, good)
    **Virtually Nobody:** (imminent, n/a)

- NS: it seems that Beneficial AI is not really a position on the moral outcome of AI, rather a nod to humanites influence/stake and our current unkowability of whether it will be extremely good or extremely bad.

**Universal Computer Theorem:** computer that can be programed to perform anything any other computer can do given enough time and memory (turing)

**Universal Intelligence** given enough time an memory can can make itself able to acompish any goal as well as any other intelligent entity.

## What is Memory?

**Substrate Independence** Computation is substrate independant! (hence AI is possib)

## What is Learning?
Things machines are good at: [arithmetic,chess, mathematical theorem proving, stock pricing, image captioning, driving, arcade game playing, Go, speech synthesis, speech transcription, translation, cancer diagnosis]. But some critics will scoff "Sure- but thats not rel intelligence"

Strong vs Weak: poor analogy (is deepblue weak?)
Narrow vs General: no problems * complexity (better)

## The Near Future
> "If we don't change direction soon, we'll end up where we're going." - Irwin Corey

NS: 2 axis of Intelligence; 
    1) automation (AI)
    2) human enhancement/evolution (Humans+AI)

- Deep reinforcement learning is a HS (Holy Shit) moment because life itself can be viewed as a game. Wohow.

NS: Claim: "Current AI systems solve problems but without being able to say how" - nope, they just think you're stupid

Turing test is fundementally about deception. Has been criticised for testing hunam gullibility more than AI.
