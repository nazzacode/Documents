- what is the highest level programming?
- I think Haskell is my Language. Rust + Scheme -> Haskelllll

### Future concepts to learn
- regex
- switch .zsh shell
- emac babay evil+org mode
- obsidian

### To Configure
- make my whole work flow UI more command line compatible
- define my own shortcut language logic (based on vim/emacs?)
    - what really matters about a language is
        1. ease of learning the basic
        2. extensiblity


### Vim
- keybinding to go to next syntax colourchange (like w)
- keybinding to next character as it it was a normal processor eol -> (l+1) bol
- ALE vs Synstastic, shortcut for ':lclose'
- look up some recomeneded shortcuts online

### Future Projects
- headcap mouse
- china vs america WWIII startergy game
- CLI+GUI user interface that shows the keyboard shortcut for everything!
